# Logical Fallacy Detection

This project aims to detect logical fallacies in speech or arguments. Logical fallacies are flaws in reasoning that might sound convincing but are based on incorrect premises. They can be challenging to detect in real-time conversations, debates, or speeches, but this tool helps to identify such fallacies automatically.

Currently, the project uses **Google Speech Recognition** to convert speech to text and then analyzes the text using the **Gemini API** for fallacy detection. The goal is to improve the model's performance in future versions.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts live audio from the microphone to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
- **Fallacy Detection**: The text is analyzed using the Gemini API to identify logical fallacies.
- **Planned Updates**: More advanced fallacy detection and better integration with future API versions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Flask (for serving the app locally)
- Gemini API (for fallacy detection)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pravargupta/logical_fallacy_detection.git
cd logical_fallacy_detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Your Gemini API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your **Gemini API** key. This key is required to access the fallacy detection service.

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Flask server to run the application on your local machine.

```bash
python server.py
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Usage

1. **Speech Input**: Speak into the microphone. The system will capture your audio, convert it to text, and save it as `output.txt`.
2. **Fallacy Detection**: The text is processed using the Gemini API to detect any logical fallacies. The results are then displayed on the local server.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance fallacy detection using a more sophisticated AI model.
- Improve error handling and optimize real-time fallacy detection.
- Integrate additional APIs for better accuracy and a wider range of fallacy types.
